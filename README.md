# Project 2
  This project was to develop a full stack application using Node and Express web server. The application is backed by a MYSQL database with a Sequelize ORM. We use routes for retreiving and adding new data.

# Critical Hit
  Our application 'Critical Hit' is designed to provide the user with various characters that can be used for a role playing game, such as DnD or Pathfinder. After the user logs in they are given the option to select an existing character or to create a character. For the design of our application we chose a more '90s theme.
